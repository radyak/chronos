# Chronos

Chronos is a structured history database that is designed to support insightful visualizations and make actual historical coherences tangible.

As a self-contained web application, it has its own frontend and provides a ReST API. Standard users can use the application without authentication to research, read and display data, whereas admins can authenticate via standard OAuth flow to add new and edit existing data.

The main idea is to not only deal with lose historical entities, but to back them with modelling of categorized properties and links between them. This allows to create impressive and revealing rendering of historical correlations and parallelisms, courses and dependencies.

* How were ancient monetary systems structured?
* Which Roman emperors had ruled for how long and died from which cause?
* How does the lineage of the Ottoman look like?

Answers to questions like these can be rendered impressively by any user, simply by researching the application's data and assembling the results in appropriate illustrations.
